# Blog Demo

## What is this application?

This is a contrived simulation of a blog application. Its purpose is not to be a blog, but to be a demonstration of the developer's programming skills.

### Who is the developer?

This application was developed by [Grant Lindsay](https://linkedin.com/in/grant-lindsay-us) (<abbr title="doing business as">d/b/a</abbr> Fast Dog Coding, LLC.)

## Is there a live version that I can see?

Coming soon.

## Can I copy this application for myself?

If you comply with the terms in the LICENSE, of course you may.

Reasons that someone may want to do that include, learning from someone else's work, evaluating the skills of the programmer, or similar purposes.

It should go without saying that passing this source code off as one's own work would be wrong.

## Working with the Source Code

This application programming interface (API) application is a Node.js + Express web server.
